The challenges only compound when the resolution requires modeling considerations in which users have not yet been trained, such as iterative domain expertise elicitation and the discipline to distinguish between refining ones own domain expertise and prior hacking. Beyond my own writing I have found exactly one book that discusses this at any depth – the collected essays of I.J. Good – and it’s not a common read.

Ultimately all we can offer with a warning is any potential quick fixes, such as increasing adapt_delta while also emphasizing that it might help but often won’t, and then an explanation that investigating computational problems requires significant statistical training along with links to the relevant pedagogical material. Any explicit recommendation will be abused by users who do not understand the context of the recommendations, just like users abuse adapt_delta today and users will abuse pithy recommendations to change their priors were that to be offered.

This is not a warning text problem – it’s a pedagogy and user expectation problem and needs to be addressed as such.
